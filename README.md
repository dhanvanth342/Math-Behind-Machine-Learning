## 🎓 Is a Master’s in Data Science Worth It?

Many of you may be asking:

- **“Is the cost worth it—especially if I study abroad?”**  
- **“What new and unique material will I actually learn?”**

Here’s my take:  
While the tuition investment can be steep, a Data Science program pushes your mathematical understanding to new heights. Courses in regression, machine learning, and data preprocessing introduce you to eye-opening concepts you might never explore in depth—unless a deadline forces you to!

## 🔍 Why Math Matters

1. **Deepens Conceptual Clarity**  
   - Understanding the “why” behind algorithms helps you choose the right tool for each problem.  
2. **Broadens Your Perspective**  
   - Real-world assignments reveal nuances you won’t encounter in standard math classes.  
3. **Builds Practical Skills**  
   - From deriving cost functions to implementing gradient descent, you learn to connect theory with code.
