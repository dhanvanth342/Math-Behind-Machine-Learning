## Exp 1 file [Dimensional Reduction, Hyper-parameter tuning, Cross validation[with handwritten function( Did not use scipy here :))]]. 
#### In this file, my work focuses on:
- Implementing cross-validation techniques for classification models using three datasets: Iris, Breast Cancer, and 20 Newsgroups. The goal is to optimize model hyperparameters and assess their performance.
- Perform Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) on a distance matrix of 24 European cities to create a 2D representation. This helped me understand the effect of dimension reduction from 24 to 2 but preserving
  the information by the original data matrix which led to similar projection of the cities in 2-d plane matching the actual positions in real world.
